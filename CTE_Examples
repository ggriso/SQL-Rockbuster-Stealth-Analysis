# Query Explanation
This query includes three different CTEs. The first one (named "top_10_countries") is meant to extract from the data set the top 10 countries by the total 
count of customers. The second one (named "top_10_cities") aims to select the top 10 cities based on the total count of customers from the previously 
selected top 10 countries. The last one (named "top_5_customers") selects the top 5 customers based on their lifetime value from the previously selected 
top 10 cities. As you can see, the three CTEs are nested into each other, and for this reason, the entire query could be written using subqueries as well.
CTEs make the code more readable and easier to understand, making them a better choice over subqueries.
The final output of this query is a list of the top 10 countries where, for each country, the total amount of customers and the amount of top customers is 
shown.
