# SQL-Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis

Exploring Rockbuster Stealth's data to address essential business inquiries vital for their strategic planning. Using SQL to identify high-revenue-generating movies and genres, map customer demographics, analyse rental history, identify high-lifetime-value customers, and compare sales across different countries.

## Rockbuster Stealth LLC Project

**Introduction:** In this project, I am engaged with Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a traditional movie rental company navigating the competitive landscape posed by streaming industry giants. My job is to lead their data strategy and assist in launching their new online video rental service. By using PostgreSQL, I will analyze different data to support the launch plan, providing Rockbuster Stealth's management with valuable insights to guide their strategy for 2020.

**Key Business Questions:**

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Context:** Throughout this project, PostgreSQL is used for detailed data analysis to address inquiries from various departments, improving decision-making for the upcoming transition to an online service. While focused on the online video streaming industry, the skills honed are versatile, and applicable across diverse sectors, showcasing strong problem-solving abilities.

**Data Set:** The data set contains information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, payments, and rental history, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It is structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
